## Stand-Outs
The data is unguided so could not relay to anyone for the missing values, had to make do with columns relevant to my analysis and all the data analysis were presented in notebooks and documented in the docs file for easy interpretation and all visualizations are in the analysis notebook and the tableau worksheet.
## Future Works
Looking forward to working with the data at the end of 2022 and exploring other features that might come with the data.
